# Sensei-Bryan
Credit to Bryan Holl for project idea (https://github.com/BryanHol)


# Deployed

**find website at https://sensei-bryan.netlify.app/**


# TODO

**MAIN GOAL - makes you think rather than answer everything and turning your brain off**

decide what frontend we want (im tinking of maybe using an api in some of messaging app maybe)
    example: talking through discord bot

decide what key features we want to build (all propositions)
    asking questions, etc
    finding sources
    generating rewarding, gamefied, study strategies


**steps for building**

1 - learn framework currently setup in **REACT**

2 - make a single page that works (doesnt)

3 - render text and make things look pretty

4 - option 1 - run everything client-side (way easier if possible)

4 - option 2 - connect somehow to our backend (very hard, if we get this done we are all geniuses and are the best)

#  options - high level ideas

**1 - teaching mode**

1.2 - start by asking what subject ( what level; college, high school, baby)
   ex: string var = college algebra; + conext "explain X + **at a college level**"

1.3 - ask their main question

1.4 - overview, example of solving question, and then finish with a practice question

1.5 - evaluate answer, and point out correct/incorrect parts of response
**1.5.2 - use fact checking for AI answers + maybe diversify sources to ensure correct answers**


**2 - flashcards**

**3 - practice test feature**

**4 - diagrams (more advenced, future stuff) (would search for images rather than generating)**


# progress

**Startup**

clone project, cd into sensei-bryan directory, and run npm start (npm may need to be installed)
