# Sensei Bryan - AI-Powered Learning Assistant

### The Problem
Many AI tools risk enabling shallow learning by giving users quick solutions, which can undermine critical thinking and deep understanding. Sensei Bryan addresses this by focusing on active learning and cognitive development.

### The Solution
By engaging users in a dialogue that requires analysis and reflection, Sensei Bryan bridges the gap between AI efficiency and genuine learning, ensuring technology enhances rather than replaces critical thinking skills.

## Project Overview

Sensei Bryan is an AI-powered chatbot designed to foster deep, critical, and active learning. Unlike traditional AI chatbots that provide direct answers, Sensei Bryan uses a Socratic teaching method to guide users through thoughtful dialogue and discovery. The goal is to help learners analyze problems, form hypotheses, develop metacognitive skills, and build lasting understanding.
