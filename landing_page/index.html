                        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                        <p>
                            Traditional AI chatbots present a significant challenge in education: they often provide direct answers, 
                            inadvertently encouraging passive learning. Students can become overly dependent on AI for solutions, 
                            bypassing the crucial cognitive processes that lead to deep understanding and retention. This "solution-first" 
                            approach undermines the fundamental principles of active learning and critical thinking development.

                        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                        <p>
                            Sensei Bryan revolutionizes AI-assisted learning by implementing a Socratic teaching method. Instead of 
                            providing immediate answers, it engages students in thought-provoking dialogue, encouraging them to:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Analyze problems independently</li>
                            <li>Form hypotheses and test assumptions</li>
                            <li>Develop metacognitive skills</li>
                            <li>Build lasting understanding through guided discovery</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            This approach bridges the gap between AI efficiency and genuine learning, ensuring that technology enhances 
                            rather than replaces critical thinking skills.
